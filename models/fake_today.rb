# You can use to_s(:db) to convert into a database friendly format.

# Time.now.to_s(:db)

# However, be careful if you have a timezone specified in Rails because the time will be stored in UTC in the database. You'll need to specify that to do proper comparisons.

# Time.now.utc.to_s(:db)

# You can also use NOW() function in MySQL instead of generating the current time in Ruby.
