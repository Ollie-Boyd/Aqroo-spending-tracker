### Brief
>
>Build an app that allows a user to track their spending. No JavaScript or other libraries. Pure Ruby, CSS, and HTML.
>
>#### MVP
>
>* The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
>* The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
>* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
>* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.
>
>##### Inspired by:
>
>Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps
>
>##### Possible Extensions
>
>* The user should be able to mark Merchants and Tags as deactivated. Users will not be able to choose deactivated merchants/tags when creating a transaction. 
>* Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.
>* The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
>* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
### Why I chose this brief
* There were a few briefs but this one really spoke to me. I love keeping up with the latest consumer and SMB fintech developments and I was really excited to plan a similar style of app. My parents were really bad at managing their money growing up and I am the complete opposite so I had in mind some features that could be nice to try and implement.
* I have a love of graphs and I was excited for the challenge of getting some dynamic graphing going without any JavaScript or libraries. 

### My initial thoughts, hopes, and aims
* I wanted the webapp to be fully responsive from phone to desktop.
* I wanted the tracker to be as slick as possible to use. I knew any friction at all will put a consumer off using it.
